# Flappy-Bird
![banner]

A ridiculous game created by [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), all you have to do is touch the screen to make the bird leap¬†as long as you avoid the flames, you'll be OK. Depending on how long you play for, the score will be calculated. On the screen, your top score will always be displayed. [Hive](https://docs.hivedb.dev/#/) is a lightweight, user-friendly, and ‚ù§Ô∏è Simple, powerful database with üéà NO native dependencies that we utilize.
